If the book you were reading had a word that you could not gleen its meaning from the context it was used in, you grabbed another book. Often, this book was bigger than the one you were reading. This was called the Dictionary. Inside was a damn trove of wonders: words, most likely the one you intended to become more intimate with. Once you found the word, you then read what that word meant. Then you were smarter, and you could use that word later in conversation with people who would hear you say that word, and nod in agreement with you because they knew what you meant, then run home and look that same word up in a dictionary to find out what you really said. Then They'd be smarter and they would go out and use that word in conversation. Thus, the cycle repeats itself. Its the Circle of Life!\n",

This stands for \"not a number,\" and can sometimes be frustrating if not dealt with. With the current dataset, the NaNs represent blank fields (\"null\" values in SQL, missing data). Due to the presence of empty values in some areas, we'll want to spend a little effort to tidy this up and make it a little easier for us to look at. To accomplish this, we'll employ the .fillna() method to replace those pesky empty values with a much nicer space, ' '."

    "\n",
    "We will be working with web traffic data from a nonprofit group that goes by the moniker [Watsi](watsi.org). Each row corresponds to some person visiting a watsi.org page, a thing called \"pageview.\" The flow of pageviews is known as \"web traffic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pageview in our data is composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'referrer' : the URL that referred the user to the site (if available), as in the person arrived via a link on Myspace (that's a thing still, right?), so the 'referrer' would be Myspace (I think that's still a thing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'timestamp' : the time the event occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'title' : the title of the page the user visited on the Watsi website.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'url' : the URL the user visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'user_agent' : the software the user used to access the site, including platform, browser, and extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'user_id' : a unique ID for each user (obfiscated to hide the identity of the guilty).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'referrer_domain' : the domain of the URL that referred the user to the site (i.e.: myspace.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'website_section' : the section of the website visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'platform' : the device platform the user visited from. For instance, 'Desktop,' or 'Mobile.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grab Yourself A Little Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Watsi enables direct funding for medical care throorugh their website. Cool right? Why does this matter? Actually, that *is* why it matters. Consider this fact, what that looks like. Take a look at some of the URLs in the data, visit them, and get comfy with the structure of the site and its content. Google Watsi and see for yourself why folks would want to get involved with them. Context is very important, as it will aid you in making better inferences in your analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample the Savory Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are just exoloring the data analysis juju in Python here, it should not be of big concern that the data we have here is 5000 rows large, which is 100 times smaller than the actual dataset of which it is a part. Our little set should be a good enough reresentation of the actual data, or so says the good people over at Mode."

If the data goddess deemsyou worthy enough to become thrust into to role of a data analyst, or data scientist, you may very well be respinsible for performing these very analyses on your company's web traffic data.

To define what type of plot we want, we will use the keyword kind=. For our example below, we'll use bar, or barh (horizontal bar chart) keywords. We can also use other keywords to adjust things like the color, size, title, etc. Take a peeksies at the documentation to see all the options available.

An example offered by the good folk at Mode (like this entire notebook of exercises and examples ;-) ) is consider a marketing analyst who is investigating an inbound website visit count. She may want to group data by channel, separating direct email, search, promotional content, advertising, referrals, organic visits, and other ways folks found the website. She may even want to look at retention rates within the groups of people (aka: cohorts) or even how folks who first visit the website behave."
